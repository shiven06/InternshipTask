# Valuing Consistent Compounders Dashboard

This Streamlit dashboard is designed to help investors analyze the financial health and intrinsic value of companies listed on the stock exchange.

- **Intrinsic Valuation**: Calculates the intrinsic P/E ratio based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis considering user-defined growth rates and periods.
